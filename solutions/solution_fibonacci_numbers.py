# # Fibonacci Numbers
# 
# Let's apply what we learned about generators by creating the so famous Fibonacci sequence.
# 
# You must create a generator that yields fibonacci numbers. This must be an infinite stream generator. Thus, the function won't receive any arguments. You should not use recursion.
# 
# Instead, you should take advantage of the fact that generators "remember" the state of the function.
# 
# Remember that the first element (index 0) is 0 and the second element (index 1)Â is 1.

        a, b = b, c
        yield b
